# Spotlight AI: Unleashing the Power of Object Recognition with YOLO Algorithm
 
The YOLOv8 project for object detection involves using the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to train a model on a dataset of images downloaded from various sources such as Google, Imgur, Flickr, etc. The project will cover a complete life cycle from data gathering through model implementation.

## Step 01
The first step in the project is to Gather a lot of images that show the different kinds of objects that the model will be able to detect. The images can either be gathered from already-existing databases or downloaded from a variety of online sources. The images should be of the highest quality and should depict a variety of different object types.

## Step 02
Once the images have been collected, they need to be labelled using a tool such as labelImg. The labelling process involves drawing bounding boxes around the objects in the images and assigning labels to them. This step is crucial, as it provides the training data for the model to learn from.

## Step 03
Next, the labelled images are split into training and testing datasets. The training dataset is used to train the YOLOv8 model, while the testing dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

The YOLOv8 model is trained using the Darknet framework, which is an open-source neural network framework. The framework is used to build and train the YOLOv8 model on the labelled images. The model is trained on the GPU for faster training.

After the model has been trained, it is evaluated on the testing dataset to determine its accuracy and performance. The evaluation process involves measuring metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Step 04
Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for object detection tasks. The model can be used to detect objects in real-time video streams or images. The deployment process involves integrating the trained model into a production environment.

In summary, the YOLOv8 project for object detection involves collecting, labelling, training, evaluating, and deploying a YOLOv8 model for object detection. The project follows a complete life cycle, from data collection to model deployment, and requires a range of skills, including data collection, labelling, machine learning, and software development.
